SELECT AVG(LENGTH) FROM FILM;

* The average length of a film is 115.2720.
*first we should find a film which has length which is more than average length of the film.
* and then find the film's category.
* Here I used  2 joins. I joined FILM_CATEGORY table with Category by using common field FILM_ID. And joined
CATEGORY table using common field CATEGORY_ID.
*This will return the name of the category with it's average length.
*To return the average length for each film category, I used GROUP BY clause and HAVING clause.
*HAVING clause provides the condition that the average length of the film that belongs to a category should be greater than
the average length of the film.
* I used the AVG() aggregate function.
* This compares itself with the Subquery which selects average length of the film.
* The result should be ordered in descending order of average length per category.
